# Eye Am Lost

Help a lonely eye find its way. Watch the eye follow your movement as you move your mouse from left to right. :eyes:

When you're ready, you can click the screen to begin music playing. As the music plays, the amplitude values of the song show up radially in the iris of the eye. The amplitude values can also be seen on the top and bottom of the screen.

Finally, the eye can relax.

I made this project initially to practice audio visualization. When I learned that audio can be visualized in a radial graph, I thought it would be really cool to make the graph be the iris of an eye. I chose to make the pupil get narrower as it turns to give the impression of the two dimentional eye rotating in a 3D space. I'm really proud of how it came out!
